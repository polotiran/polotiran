🎓 Cybersecurity student
🔭 Focus : learning, sharing & breaking stuff
⚡ Fun fact : my very first project on GitHub was...a moving square on Godot (some high-level game design 😅)

## Here you'll find
- 📝 clear and thorough notes on cybersecurity concepts (well...at least I'll try)
- 🧪 security labs for demonstration purposes
- 💡 my own reflections on problem-solving and learning
(everything coming soon 😊)
